# Computer-Software-Application-Mini-Projects

In this repo, I will share some of the Computer Software Application Projects coding with MATLAB.

1. ## *Nyquist and Step Response Function GUI*
      Main GUI is shown below.

     If the user clicks on the Nyquist, the Nyquist Function GUI opens.

     If the user clicks on the Step Response, the Step Response Function GUI opens.

2. ## *Plotting a Sine Graph*
In this mini project, the aim is to draw a sine wave graph. The amplitude of the graph is selected between 0-100 with the gauge. The user can set the start (iv), end (fv) and step (ne) values ​​for the sine wave graph with the X term. When the user moves the switch from "OFF" to "ON", the lamp color turns green and the grid lines open on the graph.

3. ## *RLC Circuit Graph*
In this mini project, we aimed to graph an specific RLC circuit output voltage value.
